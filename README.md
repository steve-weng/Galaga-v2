# Galaga-v2
Creating a classic arcade game - similar and inspired by Galaga

Galaga V2 will be similar to Galaga in that the player will move a plane around and shoot down enemy airplanes.

V2 will start with players being able to move left, right, and up.  Enemy planes will move straight down towards the player - if these hit the player or reach the bottom of the page the player loses.

If the player destroys all enemy planes on the page, a enemy fleet that moves faster will spawn.  Players will be afforded x number of lives - to be chosen by the player.
